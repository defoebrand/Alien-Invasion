# Description

The year is 2021. The New Year's celebrations just finished dying down when huge explosions seem to be heard simultaneously around the world. Before you even have time to look up you see bright beams of light shining all over the ground and people, dumbfounded, stare up into them like deer on a dark road. Good thing you have your trusty 'Rusty' shotgun with you. You hear an explosion and see an alien get shot, throwing a grenade before blowing himself up! Soldiers in hardened full-body suits start showing up out of nowhere and you know it's time! It's 2020 part 2: 2021! Alien Invasion!
